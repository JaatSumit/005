	<p>Marketing has become an essential feature for every type of business be it small or big. 
		I have worked with Internshala as College Representative and Student Partner to conduct and promote their activities among the students such as online webinar, seminar, workshops etc.
So having good marketing experience, I would like to do marketing and promotional activities for the people who are interested to promote their products or services and to reach a large audience.</p>

				<p class="heading">MANAGEMENT</p>
	<p>Management is a skill which has always fascinated me a lot.</br>
I love to manage things, people, resources.
Talking specifically, Social media management is my thing.
I have handled social media accounts of some big events. (One such event is PRAYAS, a large sports event of Indore)
Managing social media requires creativity and good audience.
I have the skills needed to manage social media promotions and marketing and attracting a large number of people on the platform.</p><p>Apart from that, I have also organised and managed some online Webinars, discussions etc.
